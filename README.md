The project you will find here is Sanascape. 
Sanascape is an action based audiogame for visually impaired individuals. The game has been created during the course Design Lab and wass created by a team of 10 people. 
The game was a testfase for the influence of vital functions and their future in games. 
This narrative horror game is influenced in its decisionmaking by the heartrate and breathing frequency.
The story takes place in an old victorian hotel in the 80's. You play as geoff, a young valet boy in service of the hotel. You're standing in the elevator when the power gets cut, 
and mysterious things start happening.
